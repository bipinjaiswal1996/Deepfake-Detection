# Deepfake-Detection

Deepfake is a type of image or video forgery technique used to invade privacy, spread misinformation, that masks the truth using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and deep learning. With the advancement in the deep learning field and availability of data, these deepfakes looks so real that they are unable to detect by human as well as traditional detection methods.

In this project, we have implemented a Capsule + LSTM based model for detecting deepfake, which focuses on detecting spatio-temporal inconsistencies across frames.
